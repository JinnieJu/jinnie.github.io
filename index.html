		<p> <b>Hello!</b>
			I am a PhD student at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Kyungpook National University,
			just started in September 2023. </p>
		<p>I am interested in tropical cyclone.
			I studied long-term change of tropical cyclone activity around East Asia during MS.
			During my PhD, I would like to learn more about the mesoscale dynamics of tropical cyclone
      such as the processes of development, and dissipation as well as structures. </p>
