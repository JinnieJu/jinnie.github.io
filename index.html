		<p> <b>Hello!</b>
			I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Kyungpook National University, started in September 2023.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about tropical cyclone.
			I studied long-term change of tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific during M.S.
			During my Ph.D., I would like to learn more about tropical cyclone rainfall, especially the structures, mesoscale dynamics, and variability.
      I'm also still interested in climatological variability of tropical cyclone activity including their formation, intensification, and effects on communities. </p>
